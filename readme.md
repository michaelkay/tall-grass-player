# Overview
The Tall Grass Player (TGP) is a mobile first client for MPD. It was specifically made to be super easy to use and for playing internet radio streams. Created to work like a radio in a car, it has very few features beyond the basics. 

## Prerequesits
TGP is a hybrid web app which runs off a web server. The following must be installed to the app:
- Apache or lighttpd
- php
- php:PDO (should be included by defalt with PHP)
- PDO_SQLITE (should be included by default with PHP)
- MPD (needs to be installed somewhere)
For instructions on how to setup php with lighttpd see [this blog post](http://raspberrypimaker.com/installing-php-lighttpd-debian-stretch/)

## Installation
1. Close the git repository or download and unzip in a web folder
1. In Linux, change the owner of the radio.db file so the web server user can alter the file
   - For example `chown www-data:www-data radio.db`
1. Download and install the dependant libraries
   - `cd vendor`
   - run `deps.sh` (linux) or `deps.bat` (windows)
1. If MPD is on a different server from the web server, the address in `api/init.php` should be altered.
   - NOTE: If MPD is on a different server, make sure the mdp.conf is edited to allow network access (set `bind_to_address` to "any").
1. Thats it!
